# LQ-500 3C Firmware Design Overview

This is a working map of the 3C program PROM architecture. Names are based on
the vector trace, high fan-in call sites, hardware register accesses, and local
instruction patterns. Treat medium/low-confidence labels as useful handles, not
final symbol names.

## Execution Shape

The firmware is organized around a small set of layers:

| Layer | Main addresses | Current role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vector and CALT layer | `0000h-00BFh` | Reset/IRQ stubs plus compact one-byte service calls. |
| Boot/init | `0180h-0571h` | Clears RAM/windows, probes optional PROM/CG windows, initializes ports/timers/gate-array registers. |
| Real-time I/O | `0582h-09C1h` | Interrupt handlers for `F000h` gate data, serial RXB, timers, and print mechanism state. |
| Text/render core | `0F16h-2DCDh` | Character state, glyph metric lookup, work-buffer layout, and render-band advancement. |
| Inline render table/fill | `2DCEh-3FFFh` | Small inline dispatch tail at `2DCEh-2DE2h`, then unused `FFh` fill through `3FFFh`. |
| Character dispatcher and glyph transforms | `4008h-5793h` | `PBLS` secondary body containing character classification, font-state selection, and many bitmap expansion transforms. |
| Static data/tables | `6000h-739Ah` | Identity/remap table, strings, character-set tables, mechanism timing tables, and render geometry tables. |
| Service/test UI | `739Bh-7B73h` | Data-dump, DIP/status printout, bidirectional adjustment/calibration UI, and string/number formatting helpers. |

## Panel, DIP, and Host I/O

The most useful hardware-facing split so far is:

| Address | Working label | Current read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0582h` | `isr_gate_f000_input_capture_buffer` | Interrupt path that reads `F000h`, stores the byte into the shared `EE20h` input buffer, restores `F002h`, and toggles `F001h` bits when the buffer state changes. Candidate parallel-port data path. |
| `05E2h` | `isr_rxb_host_receive_buffer` | CPU `RXB` receive interrupt path. It checks `ER`, handles NUL/error cases, and writes into the same `EE20h` input buffer as the `F000h` path. |
| `4EEAh` | `read_panel_buttons_debounced` | Returns a compact button/action bitfield: `01h` = LINE FEED/AUTO LOAD, `02h` = FORM FEED, `04h` = ON LINE. Bidirectional-adjustment mode waits for return to zero before accepting another action. |
| `4F37h` | `read_dip_switches_and_panel_pa_bits` | Startup switch read. Calls the ADC/table reader twice, writes `VV00`/`VV01`, then folds PA bits `04h` and `08h` into `VV01`. |
| `4F54h` | `read_adc_switch_table_bits` | Walks compact tables at `4F96h`/`4F9Fh`; each entry chooses an `F002h`/ADC mode through `508Dh` and compares the resulting sample against a threshold. |
| `4FB1h` | `sample_vr_adjustment_adc_offsets` | Startup and bidirectional-adjustment sampler. It averages ADC channels and stores signed/clamped offsets in the `EE28h` area used by the adjustment UI. |

This means the DIP switches and service-panel inputs are likely a mix of direct
port bits and analog/multiplexed switch reads. The code does not support a
simple "one DIP bank equals one CPU port" model.

Known bit-level handles:

| Signal in code | Current meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PC bit 20h` | Debounced by `4EF9h`; returned from `4EEAh` as `01h` = LINE FEED/AUTO LOAD. |
| `PC bit 10h` | Debounced by `4EF9h`; returned from `4EEAh` as `02h` = FORM FEED. |
| `PC bit 08h` plus `F2` | Sampled by `4F21h`; returned from `4EEAh` as `04h` = ON LINE. |
| `PA bits 04h/08h` | Sampled by `4F37h` after the two ADC switch-table reads and merged into `VV01`. |
| `PA bit 10h` | Used repeatedly in data-dump and service flows as a wait/confirm-style input. |
| PA5 / `PA mask 20h` | Raw input sampled by startup carriage home-seek code around `51F7h-5241h`. Schematic review shows PA5 has a 15K pullup to `+5 V`, and the far-left HOME switch closes to ground, so clear samples are active-low HOME assertions. |
| `PA bit 00h` / `PB bit 80h` | Written by `7B52h` during service/adjustment UI setup. |

## Self-Test Status Header

The LINE FEED/AUTO LOAD and FORM FEED power-on paths share the same status
printer after selecting draft or letter-quality mode. The flow is:

| Address | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `74CBh` | Draft self-test entry; sets `VV23.2`. |
| `74CFh` | Letter Quality self-test entry; clears `VV23.2`. |
| `7552h` | Prints the `6100h` firmware header string (`L5217B`) and advances output. |
| `75C7h` | Saves `VV22`/`VV23`/`VV24`, selects the status print style, walks the two-column pointer table at `61AAh`, and restores the previous style. |
| `760Ah` | Builds the selected status selector IDs in `FF00h` from `VV00`/`VV01`. |
| `76C2h` | Prints one selector-prefixed status string, emphasized only when its selector byte is present in the `FF00h` selected-ID list. |

This explains the manual's "prints current DIP switch settings" behavior. The
strings at `6230h-67EFh` contain all possible values, while `760Ah` chooses one
selector per status group. `76C2h` sets `VV24.4` before printing each value and
clears it only for unselected values, so the selected row is printed in
emphasized/bold mode. It is not using the double-strike flag; `VV24.6` is the
separate `ESC G`/`ESC H` double-strike bit.

The extracted selector text is mirrored in
`data/lq500_3c_selftest_status_selectors.tsv`.

The larger `6000h-6FFFh` block is now split by consumer in
`data/lq500_3c_6000_block_usage.tsv`. The service-visible text runs from
`6100h` through `67EFh`; the rest of the block is lookup and dispatch data:
`6000h` is the host-byte remap table used by `4038h`, `67F0h-689Bh` is
render/glyph setup data, `689Ch-6943h` is the international character
substitution table used by `1464h`, and `696Eh-6A59h` is the primary/ESC command
dispatch table area. The two CSF parenthesized strings at `617Fh` and `6187h`
have no direct traced consumer yet.

The adjacent `7000h-7B73h` region is split by consumer in
`data/lq500_3c_7000_block_usage.tsv`. The important split is that
`7001h-739Ah` is normal mechanism/timing/render lookup data, while
`739Bh-7B73h` is executable service/test code. The service block contains the
power-on panel dispatch, data dump, self-test status printing, and the
bidirectional adjustment/calibration UI. The adjustment UI starts at `7818h`,
prints `Bi-d Adjustment Mode`, displays `VR1`/`VR2`, reads panel actions via
`4EEAh`, and refreshes ADC-derived offset values via `4FB1h`.

## Input Pipeline

The host input path from the candidate parallel ISR to the parser now has a
clear shape:

1. `0582h` (`isr_gate_f000_input_capture_buffer`) reads a byte from `F000h` and
   writes it to the ring buffer at the `EE20h` write pointer.
2. `05E2h` (`isr_rxb_host_receive_buffer`) is the alternate CPU `RXB` receive
   path and writes into the same buffer.
3. Both ISR paths increment the pending-byte count at `EE1Eh`; startup seeds
   both `EE20h` and `EE22h` to `8500h`.
4. `0A0Bh` (`read_next_host_input_byte`) waits for `EE1Eh` to become nonzero,
   reads one byte through the `EE22h` read pointer using `F002h=0C0h`, advances
   `EE22h`, decrements `EE1Eh`, and returns the byte in `A`.
5. `400Bh` (`main_input_decode_loop`) calls that reader via `CALT ($0080)`,
   classifies the byte with `4038h`, and then either enters printable output at
   `4012h` or command dispatch at `6944h`.

The command dispatcher is table-driven:

| Address | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `6944h` | Pushes `400Bh` as the loop return, scans a count-prefixed byte/target table, and jumps to a matched handler. |
| `696Eh` | Primary control-command table: `ESC`, `LF`, `CR`, `BEL`, `BS`, `HT`, `VT`, `FF`, `SO`, `SI`, `DC2`, `DC3`, `DC4`, `CAN`. |
| `695Bh` | ESC entry from the primary table; reads the next byte through `0AB2h` and switches to the ESC table. |
| `699Ch` | ESC command table with 62 byte/handler entries, including `ESC @`, line spacing/page commands, graphics commands, and style commands. |

This proves the candidate parallel path and the CPU `RXB` path converge before
ESC/P parsing. Command handlers consume their parameters by calling the same
input-byte helpers, so tracing parser behavior should start from the two command
tables rather than from the ISR bodies.

FX-80 compatibility cross-checks:

| Command | LQ-500 handler | Current interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ESC j n` | `2568h` | Matches FX-80 reverse-feed compatibility. The LQ-500 handler reads `n`, sets `H=80h`, and enters the shared immediate-feed path used by `ESC J` with `H=00h`. |
| `ESC s n` | `0A0Bh` | FX-80 half-speed compatibility candidate. LQ-500 consumes one parameter but no state change is identified yet. |
| `ESC r n` | `0A0Bh` | Not found in the FX-80 notes checked so far. LQ-500 consumes one parameter only, likely preserving stream sync for a compatibility command. |
| `ESC h n` | `0A0Bh` | Not found in the FX-80 notes checked so far. LQ-500 consumes one parameter only, likely preserving stream sync for a compatibility command. |

## Command Behavior Audit

Detailed command behavior is tracked in
`data/lq500_3c_command_behaviors.tsv`. That table mirrors all 76 entries from
`data/lq500_3c_command_dispatch_tables.tsv` and records parameter consumption,
raw state updates, evidence addresses, and audit status.

Current split:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `audited` | Handler is small enough or direct enough that parameter consumption and state effects are recorded as raw firmware behavior. |
| `audited_partial` | Entry behavior is traced far enough to identify parameters and key state updates, but shared render/feed/graphics/user-character machinery still needs deeper decomposition. |
| `needs_hardware_correlation` | Firmware behavior is known, but the documented command effect depends on external signal meaning. |

High-confidence simple handlers now include the style/pitch flags (`ESC E/F`,
`ESC G/H`, `ESC 4/5`, `ESC P/M/g`, `ESC p`, `ESC W`, `SO/SI/DC2/DC4`), MSB
control (`ESC #`, `ESC =`, `ESC >`), tab selection (`ESC /`), line-spacing raw updates
(`ESC 0/2/3/A`), and compatibility/no-op consumers (`ESC s/r/h`). Larger
paths that still need follow-up are the shared feed/advance path
(`LF/CR/FF/VT`, `ESC J/j`), graphics (`ESC *` and `ESC K/L/Y/Z`), and
user-defined character commands (`ESC &`, `ESC :`).

## Character Path

The probable normal character flow is:

1. A byte is read by `400Bh` through the shared input-buffer consumer at
   `0A0Bh`.
2. It is classified by `4038h` (`classify_input_character_and_select_style_state`).
3. Font/style state is copied into `VV21`, `VV22`, and `VV1F`.
4. Extended printable ranges are checked by `2824h`.
5. Glyph metrics are derived by the `1Cxxh-1Dxxh` family:
   - `1CF2h` selects `8000h` or `8600h` and reads per-character metrics into `EF99`/`EF9B`.
   - `1D65h` reconciles glyph width and active buffer pointers.
   - `1DDFh`/`1DFEh` compute source/work pointers around `EE88`.
6. The glyph is expanded into a work buffer by one of the `43DDh-4C36h` transform paths.
7. The print/render advance path enters through `2011h` and reaches the larger `256Eh`/`29xxh` loops.

## Glyph Transform Families

The `43DDh-4C36h` region looks like the resident bitmap expansion engine. It
uses `VV99` as an active width/count and `VV:CF` as a destination stride.
`EE88`/`EE8A` are source/work pointers; `EF95`, `EF97`, and `EF9B` are glyph
metric or edge pointers.

Notable helpers:

| Address | Working label | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `45B1h` | `or_shifted_columns_left_into_work_buffer` | Shifts source data left and ORs into destination bytes. |
| `45F8h` | `or_shifted_columns_right_into_work_buffer` | Mirrors the left-shift helper using right shifts. |
| `463Fh` | `xor_or_mask_shifted_columns_into_work_buffer` | Uses `XRAX`/masking while walking destination columns. |
| `4664h` | `adjust_glyph_width_and_right_edge_metrics` | Updates `VV99`, `EF95`, `EF97`, and `EF9B`. |
| `49ADh` | `expand_high_nibble_to_2bit_pairs` | Converts high-nibble bits into paired masks `C0/30/0C/03`. |
| `49C5h` | `condense_or_mask_glyph_columns` | Uses inverted masks and halves/condenses metrics afterward. |
| `4AA8h` | `copy_2byte_glyph_columns_to_3byte_work_rows` | Copies 2 source bytes plus a zero byte, with order selected by a flag. |
| `4ACEh` | `write_packed_glyph_nibbles_to_work_buffer` | Writes packed groups into destination offsets `0/3/6/9`. |

This strongly suggests that the 4C CG data is not a single direct framebuffer
layout. The program ROM contains multiple format converters for different pitch,
quality, width, and style combinations.

## Mechanical Outputs

Mechanical documentation is split by subsystem:

| Subsystem | Detailed doc | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Paper Feed | `docs/lq500_3c_paper_feed.md` | Paper advance/retard, `PB2` drive/hold, `PB3`/`PB4` phase switching, ESC J/j feed distance, and paper-feed timing. |
| Carriage Operation | `docs/lq500_3c_carriage_operation.md` | Carriage home seek, position/timing, current selection, `PC7`/`TM`, and `F003h` control. |
| Printhead | `docs/lq500_3c_printhead.md` | Head-interface registers, print-data burst output, and future pin firing analysis. |

Keep these domains separate. Print pin firing is a head-output workstream, not
part of carriage movement, even though normal printing couples head timing to
carriage motion.

Current ROM anchors:

- Paper feed command motion enters through `ESC J`/`ESC j`, stores a signed
  distance through the vertical-advance path, sets `VV62=1`, and reaches the
  FE1 paper-feed ISR branch that calls `093Eh` for counted `PB & 18h` phase
  updates. The `540Dh`/`PB mask 04h` path controls the paper-feed drive/hold
  window around those counted steps.
- Carriage movement uses `0908h` as the `PC7`/`TM` phase-step pulse. Startup
  home seek is the `51F7h-5253h` path; runtime movement uses the queued
  scheduler, `72B3h` TM1 sequence records, `7005h` timing/output records, and
  F003 control helpers.
- Printhead output is currently anchored at `F004h/F005h`: `08D0h` arms a
  burst, `0978h` emits three bytes through the alternate-register `BC=F005h`
  path, and `563Ch` sets up the data pointers and timing values.

## Service/Test Path

The `739Bh-7B73h` block is a service UI layer. It should be kept separate from
the preceding `7001h-739Ah` table region, which is consumed by normal
mechanism/timing and render-layout code:

- Startup builds `VV0C` from the panel bits: `01h` enters Draft self-test
  (LINE FEED/AUTO LOAD held), `02h` enters LQ self-test (FORM FEED held),
  `03h` enters data dump (LINE FEED plus FORM FEED), and `07h` is remapped to
  `08h` for bidirectional adjustment (ON LINE plus FORM FEED plus LINE FEED).
- `73AFh` prints a data-dump style grid using the `8000h` work window.
- `74CBh` is the Draft self-test entry; `74CFh` is the Letter Quality self-test
  entry. They differ by setting or clearing `VV23` bit `04h` before common
  self-test printing.
- `746Fh` converts nibbles to ASCII hex.
- `7476h` prints a single dump cell through the same character classifier used
  by normal text.
- `755Dh` prints `00h`/`FFh` terminated strings.
- `7719h` handles the documented data dump paper length messaging.
- `7818h` handles bidirectional adjustment mode and its `VR1`/`VR2` display,
  using `4EEAh` panel-action reads and `4FB1h` ADC offset refreshes.
- `79D4h`, `79F6h`, and `7A00h` are local adjustment display helpers for
  marker output, service strings, and value formatting.
- `7A18h-7A52h` holds the adjustment title, `VR1`/`VR2` labels, plus/minus
  markers, and the out-of-range string.
- `7AB2h-7B51h` maintains shared style/typeface selection state used by service
  and startup flows before `7B52h` reflects the selection on PA/PB outputs.

## Open Naming Questions

- Confirm whether the `0582h` `F000h` ISR is the Centronics/parallel data path
  or an intermediate gate-array FIFO/status path fed by the parallel interface.
- The exact meaning of style bits in `VV22`, `VV23`, `VV27`, `VV28`, `VV29`,
  `VV2A`, `VV88`, and `VV89` still needs correlation against ESC/P commands.
- `4008h` is reached after the `PBLS` check but shares normal character and
  render code, so it should be treated as a resident secondary body, not
  necessarily as an external option ROM.
- The `JEA` computed jumps at `02DCh`, `240Ah`, `5468h`, and `761Ch` need
  target recovery. `5468h` indexes the PA/PB mechanism-output table at `7007h`;
  `761Ch` is clearly part of service/status string assembly.
